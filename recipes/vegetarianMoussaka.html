    1 eggplant, thinly sliced

    1 teaspoon salt, or more as needed

    1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed

    1 large zucchini, thinly sliced

    2 potatoes, thinly sliced

    1 onion, sliced

    1 clove garlic, chopped

    1 tablespoon white vinegar

    1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped

    ½ (14.5 ounce) can lentils, drained with liquid reserved

    2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

    1 teaspoon dried oregano

    ground black pepper to taste

    1 cup crumbled feta cheese
    Sauce:

    1 ¼ cups milk

    2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

    1 ½ tablespoons butter

    1 pinch ground nutmeg

    ground black pepper to taste

    1 large egg, beaten
    Topping:

    ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

    DirectionsInstructions Checklist
    Step 1
    Sprinkle eggplant slices with salt; set aside for 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry with paper towels.

    Step 2
    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

    Step 3
    Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook eggplant and zucchini in hot oil until lightly
    browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel-lined plate, reserving as
    much oil as possible in the skillet.

    Step 4
    Add more oil to the skillet if needed and let it get hot. Cook potato slices in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5
    minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel-lined plate, again reserving oil in the
    skillet.

    Step 5
    Sauté onion and garlic in reserved oil until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in vinegar, bring to a boil, and
    reduce heat to medium-low; cook until liquid is reduced in volume and thick. Stir in tomatoes, lentils, 1/2 of the
    juice from lentils, parsley, and oregano. Season with salt and black pepper. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and
    simmer for 15 minutes.

    Step 6
    Layer about 1/3 of the eggplant, 1/3 of the zucchini, 1/2 of the potatoes, and 1/2 of the feta in a 9x13-inch baking
    dish. Pour 1/2 of the tomato mixture over vegetables; repeat layering, finishing with a layer of eggplant and
    zucchini.

    Step 7
    Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.

    Step 8
    Meanwhile, make the sauce: Stir milk, flour, and butter for together in a small saucepan; bring to a low boil,
    whisking constantly, until thick and smooth. Season with nutmeg and black pepper. Remove from heat, cool for 5
    minutes, and stir in beaten egg.

    Step 9
    Pour sauce over vegetables and top with Parmesan cheese. Continue baking, uncovered, until sauce is bubbly and top
    is lightly brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
