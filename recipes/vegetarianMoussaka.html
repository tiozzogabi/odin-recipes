        <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <h4>Sauce:</h4>
        <li>1¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <h4>Topping:/h4>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle eggplant slices with salt; set aside for 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook eggplant and zucchini in hot oil until
            lightly
            browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel-lined plate,
            reserving as
            much oil as possible in the skillet.
        </li>
        <li> Add more oil to the skillet if needed and let it get hot. Cook potato slices in hot oil until browned, 3 to
            5
            minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel-lined plate, again reserving oil in
            the
            skillet.
        </li>
        <li> Sauté onion and garlic in reserved oil until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in vinegar, bring to a
            boil, and
            reduce heat to medium-low; cook until liquid is reduced in volume and thick. Stir in tomatoes, lentils, 1/2
            of the
            juice from lentils, parsley, and oregano. Season with salt and black pepper. Cover, reduce heat to
            medium-low, and
            simmer for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li> Layer about 1/3 of the eggplant, 1/3 of the zucchini, 1/2 of the potatoes, and 1/2 of the feta in a
            9x13-inch baking
            dish. Pour 1/2 of the tomato mixture over vegetables; repeat layering, finishing with a layer of eggplant
            and
            zucchini.
        </li>
        <li> Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, make the sauce: Stir milk, flour, and butter for together in a small saucepan; bring to a low
            boil,
            whisking constantly, until thick and smooth. Season with nutmeg and black pepper. Remove from heat, cool for
            5
            minutes, and stir in beaten egg.
        </li>
        <li> Pour sauce over vegetables and top with Parmesan cheese. Continue baking, uncovered, until sauce is bubbly
            and top
            is lightly brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
